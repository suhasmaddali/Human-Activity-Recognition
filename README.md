## Introduction 

```diff
+ This project was developed with the help of https://www.appliedaicourse.com/ based in India. üôÇ
```

With a large volume of __smartwatches__ and __phones__ being manufactured, there is a huge amount of data generated by them. In fact, smartwatches have various sensors that would track activities of users. With the aid of machine learning and deep learning, human activity could be predicted. In addition, mobile phones are using machine learning to detect the chances of users driving a car or not. There are many other interesting applications which are discussed in the notebook.

## Machine Learning Analysis
In this project, we are going to be working with machine learning and deep learning algorithms that would predict the activity performed by users based on the tracking data. Feel free to open the ipython notebook to get started. Thanks! 

## üëâ Directions to download the repository and run the notebook 

This is for the Washington Bike Demand Prediction repository. But the same steps could be followed for this repository. 

1. You'll have to download and install Git that could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.
 
&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Human-Activity-Recognition/blob/master/images/Screenshot%20(14).png" width = "600"/>
 
2. Once "Git" is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to download this repository. I would like to store it in "Git Folder" location. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Human-Activity-Recognition/blob/master/images/Screenshot%20(15).png" width = "600" />

3. If you have successfully installed Git, you'll get an option called "Gitbash Here" when you right-click on a particular location. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Human-Activity-Recognition/blob/master/images/Screenshot%20(16).png" width = "600" />


4. Once the Gitbash terminal opens, you'll need to write "Git clone" and then paste the link of the repository.
 
&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Human-Activity-Recognition/blob/master/images/Screenshot%20(18).png" width = "600" />

5. The link of the repository can be found when you click on "Code" (Green button) and then, there would be a html link just below. Therefore, the command to download a particular repository should be "Git clone html" where the html is replaced by the link to this repository. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Human-Activity-Recognition/blob/master/images/Screenshot%20(17).png" width = "600" />

6. After successfully downloading the repository, there should be a folder with the name of the repository as can be seen below.

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Human-Activity-Recognition/blob/master/images/Screenshot%20(19).png" width = "600" />

7. Once the repository is downloaded, go to the start button and search for "Anaconda Prompt" if you have anaconda installed. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Human-Activity-Recognition/blob/master/images/Screenshot%20(20).png" width = "600" />

8. Later, open the jupyter notebook by writing "jupyter notebook" in the Anaconda prompt. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Human-Activity-Recognition/blob/master/images/Screenshot%20(21).png" width = "600" />

9. Now the following would open with a list of directories. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Human-Activity-Recognition/blob/master/images/Screenshot%20(22).png" width = "600" />

10. Search for the location where you have downloaded the repository. Be sure to open that folder. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Human-Activity-Recognition/blob/master/images/Screenshot%20(12).png" width = "600" />

11. You might now run the .ipynb files present in the repository to open the notebook and the python code present in it. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Human-Activity-Recognition/blob/master/images/Screenshot%20(13).png" width = "600" />

That's it, you should be able to read the code now. Thanks.
